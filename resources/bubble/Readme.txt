This is the method I used in my Squirrel Bubble Game (http://www.neatfilm.net) to load external assets dynamically.
You could load any type of assets from external swf files at any time you like to.

This example is to load a list of sounds hosting in the external sounds.swf file. In case of MovieClip assets, I would like to put only Mc for each external swf file, and return them directly but not an Array. But array is powerful when you have multiple assets to be loaded a single time.

AssetLoader class included.

Thanks,
George
